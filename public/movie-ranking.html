<h1> MY FAVOURITE MOVIES </h1>

<p>Top 5 movies of all time</p>

<hr />

<h2> Jab We Met </h2>

<p> I love this movie because in this movie Geet is full of life & outspoken girl and Geet actually taught Aditya and us that how we should always enjoy our life in every situation, we should not worry alot about our future and past, because we don't have any control on that. We should always live in the present and should always enjoy our life to the fullest. This movie is full of positivity thats why i love this movie. </p>

<h2> Ajab Prem Ki Gajab Kahani </h2>

<p> I love this movie because its great combo of romance and comedy, also the characters in this i really adore Prem & Jenny character, I can watch this movie infinite times.  </p>

<h2> Atithi Tum Kab Jaaoge </h2>

<p> Nothing much, I just love watching this movie because of the comedy this movie have is on another level, also I feel very positive while watching this movie because there the importance of ganpati festival in mumbai is explained very nicely by Paresh Rawal sir, and I really really love lord Ganesha from my childhood, So, I feel very connected and close to Ganesh ji always. That's why I love this movie. </p>

<h2> Chhaava </h2>

<p> I love this movie because it shows that what Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj did for us, he is pride of marathas, And not only Marathas he is pride of every indian, if we all are living now its because of him. The bravery he showed is commendable, I just love him and respect him as well as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj too for raising a lion like him. I love maratha culture and maratha people. Hatts Off to all of them from the core of my heart.</p>
